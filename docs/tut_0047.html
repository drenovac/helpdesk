                <h1>Explanation</h1>
                <p>In the course of payroll processing, 
                various validations and edits are carried out against all employees selected for payment. </p>
                <img src="../2013/helpdesk/img/hd_0047a.png" alt="exception report" height="121" width="585">
                <p>In the case of this particular problem, we recommend you debug the process in the following order:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Confirm that the employee has shifts in the payroll processing period</li>
                <li>Open a shift within that period and confirm that the shift is correctly costed</li>
                <li>Check the employee's payroll rates tab to confirm their payment processing details</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Confirming the employee's shifts through the scheduling workbench confirms that the employee has shifts for processing and that they are correctly costed.<br>
                The secondary validation that you get from checking the costs of the shift is to confirm that the shifts are not actually already paid in another pay-run. When you edit a shift, the system will indicate that the shift is already paid (were that the case).</p>
                <p>Verifying the employees pay details, shows the following:</p>
                <p><img src="../2013/helpdesk/img/hd_0047.png" alt="pay rates" height="187" width="436"><br>
                </p>
                <p>What this shows is that the Pay Class does not have a description, which means that the control record for the pay class does not exist.</p>
                <p>If you look carefully, you will see that there's a space in the text, that this classification is in fact "FLAT 1", not "FLAT1", and hence the cause of the error.</p>
                <p><br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>This particular diagnosis indicates that this employee's record was changed post the shifts being processed into the system, as they show the correct code of "FLAT1".<br>
                </p>
                <p>And, it shows that the entry was made manually rather than via a selection of a dropdown - which would automatically populate the description field.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
