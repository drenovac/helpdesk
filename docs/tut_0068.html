					<h1>The issue</h1>
				  <p>The issue presents ifself as shown in the image below. The duplication of shifts for an employee.<br>
			      From prior experience, we (helpdesk) believe this is a data corruption caused by issues which we'll explain at the end of this article</p>
				  <p>To verify that it is indeed simple data corruption, click on the employee name in the 1st column.<br>
			      Then click on the employee tab - if on the employee tab, you see no duplicate shifts, then the fix is a very simple one (one that you may correct yourself).</p>
				  <p>If on the employee tab, you see the shifts also duplicated, then it's likely an indexing issue and helpdesk will have to assist to sort that for you.</p>
				  <p><br>
				    <img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68a.png" alt="duplicate shifts" height="147" width="453"></p>
				  <p>The first thing is to locate the physical location of where your Powerforce software is sitting.<br>
				    Right click on the Powerforce shortcut, so that you get an image which looks vaguely similar to the image below.
				  </p>
				  <p><img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68b.png" height="371" width="365"></p>
				  <p>The quickest path to the next step, is to click on the "Find Target" button on the shortcut properties - which will open a File Manager window for you, in a mode and display similar to that showing below.</p>
				  <p>You can see that you've opened the directory known as "Start in", and the program that is powerforce is selected "oinsight.exe".</p>
				  <p><img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68c.png" height="582" width="786"></p>
				  <p>In that same directory that is now open, you will have a sub-directory called "clean_syslists" as showing below.</p>
				  <p>Ensure at this stage, that you and all your other users are out of Powerforce (the application).</p>
				  <p><img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68d.png" height="240" width="798"></p>
				  <p>Double click on the name of the sub-directory, so that the file manager opens to the sub-directory.</p>
				  <p>Then 'select' all the files as shown, and right click to select "Copy" as the next action</p>
				  <p><img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68e.png" height="182" width="386"></p>
				  <p>Because you are in a sub-directory, you need to get back to the main directory, so using the images below, click on the icon showing in the selection (the up-approw, meaning 'pop' or "go up")</p>
				  <p><img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68f.png" height="144" width="440"></p>
				  <p>Without touching (selecting anything) once you've 'popped' directories, right click your mouse, and select "Paste" (as shown, to copy the files)</p>
				  <p><img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68g.png" height="196" width="409"></p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <p>If everything has worked corectly up to this stage, you will be challenged with a message like this shown below.</p>
				  <p>Respond "Yes" to copy the files.</p>
				  <p><img src="../2014/helpdesk/img/hd_68h.png" height="252" width="422"></p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <h1>Summary</h1>
				  <p>The technical reason for the problem is that Powerforce uses a couple of system files for its 'scratch pad'. A scratch pad is not much different to what any human may use one for - to do working out, etc. In the case of Poweforce it uses it for sorting and keeping lists.</p>
				  <p>When this scratch pad gets somehow corrupted, Powerforce gets in a twist and errors arise. Therefore the fix is to clean out the scratch pad.<br>
			      The procedure described above is the quickest clean out - we simply replace the scratch pad (files), with a clean piece of paper.</p>
				  <p>Meanwhile, the issue is caused by:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Generally caused when a users abort out of  Powerforce because something / some process was stuck</li>
                      <li>If users leave PCs or laptops logged in overnight. Your users must log out of Powerforce when their session is completed.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                  </ul>
